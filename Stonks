This is my way of solving "Stonks" on PicoCTF, there are a bunch of ways, including compiling the code with gcc etc, lets try the easy way!

Firstly, lets install the vuln.c script on the challenge page.

1. The challenge gives us a ssh command "nc mercury.picoctf.net 20195" once typed in and ran, this will open a menu to buy or view things.
2. Type in "1" and hit enter.
3. We then have to enter just enough of "%x" to overflow the flag  _EX: (%x%x%x)_ capital X will not work. 
     - For me 100 %x's worked to get it.

5. It will spit out a jumbled mess of a token just under **"Buying stonks with token"** 
6. Lets go ahead and open a converter such as **https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-hex.html**
7. We must convert hex to text via ASCII encoding, so PASTE the token you got from the server into the drop file box and hit convert

8. A bit hard to tell but we receive "ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n5406d06dÿ¼}" which looks a bit intimidating but its not bad once we get to the next step
9. Delete all the jumbled mess that's in the drop text area and paste "ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n5406d06dÿ¼}"
10. At the top change it from what it is now to **From TEXT to HEXADECIMAL** then we get a bunch of hexadecimal we can then throw into CyberChef 
11.  In the link below is what I got from rapid tables pasted into CyberChef, with swap endianness, and converted from hex. if you received a bit different than my "ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n5406d06dÿ¼}" just paste yours in place of mine and then VOILA! You now have the flag!

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Swap_endianness('Hex',4,true)From_Hex('Auto')&input=NkYgNjMgNjkgNzAgN0IgNDYgNTQgNDMgMzAgNkMgNUYgNDkgMzQgNUYgNzQgMzUgNkQgNUYgNkMgNkMgMzAgNkQgNUYgNzkgNUYgNzkgMzMgNkUgMzUgMzQgMzAgMzYgNjQgMzAgMzYgNjQgRkYgQkMgN0Q&oeol=FF


**DO NOTE**
This flag below me you will have to remove a bit of jumbled mess at the end like on mine
